## Introduction
[Fenced code blocks][4] are a very useful feature of GitHub Flavored Markdown.
With this plugin you can edit the fragment of code embedded inside the
markdown with the right filetype.

## Install
If you use [Vundle][1] you can install this plugin using Vim command `:BundleInstall amiorin/vim-fenced-code-blocks`.
Don't forget put a line `Bundle 'amiorin/vim-fenced-code-blocks'` in your `.vimrc`.

If you use [Pathogen][2], you just execute following:

```sh
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/amiorin/vim-fenced-code-blocks.git
```

If you don't use either plugin management system, copy the `plugin` directory to your `.vim` directory.

\*nix: $HOME/.vim
Windows: $HOME/vimfiles

## Use
This plugin defines 4 new commands:

* ``:E`` to edit in the same window, ``CTRL-^`` to go back to the markdown file
* ``:EV`` to edit in the vertical split window, ``CTRL-W l`` to go back to the markdown file
* ``:ES`` to edit in the horizontal split window, ``CTRL-W j`` to go back to the markdown file
* ``:ET`` to edit in a new tab.

All the commands accept the ``bang``.
